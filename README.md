# Silicon Labs Matter

Welcome to the Silicon Labs Matter Github repo. Matter is an application layer
that provides a standardized interface between protocols and devices. With
Matter, it is transparent to the underlying device whether the interaction is
from a Thread application or a Wi-Fi application. For more information on Matter
in general see the main
[Matter Overview](https://www.silabs.com/wireless/matter) page. This repo is the
starting point for all Silicon Labs-related Matter development. Silicon Labs
supports Matter on both 802.15.4 (Thread) and 802.11 (Wi-Fi) transport
protocols.

_To see release notes containing list of features and knowns issues go to
[SiliconLabs/matter/releases](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/matter/releases)
and find the corresponding notes for the release you are using._

As seen below, Silicon Labs supports Matter on several different hardware platforms including the EFR32, RS9116, WF200 and the new SiWx917 which is a Wi-Fi System-on-Chip (SoC).

Device: EFR32+RS9116

Device: SiWx917 SoC

This repo contains documentation, demos, examples and all the code needed for Matter Accessory Device development on both Thread and Wi-Fi. The Thread development use cases differs from Wi-Fi because the Thread protocol requires the use of an Open Thread Border Router (OTBR).  

-   To get started with the Thread demo and development see
    [Matter Thread](https://siliconlabs.github.io/matter/2.1.0-1.1/thread/DEMO_OVERVIEW.html)
-   To get started with the Wi-Fi demo and development see
    [Matter Wi-Fi](https://siliconlabs.github.io/matter/2.1.0-1.1/wifi/DEMO_OVERVIEW.html)
